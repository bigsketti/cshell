This is a basic terminal written in plain ol' C. I'm writing this to dip my toes into C and learn a little about systems development.
This will never reach the level of bash or zsh, I'm a college student without that kind of time or knowledge.

THIS ONLY WORKS ON LINUX, IF FOR WHATEVER REASON YOU WANT TO PLAY WITH THIS AND YOURE ON WINDOWS YOU MUST USE WSL (Windows subsystem for Linux)

No need to compile the source code to run, simply download the binary from the repository. It always contains the most recently compiled version of cShell.
