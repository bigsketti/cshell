# Welcome to cShell

**cShell** is a compact terminal written in **C**.

This cutting-edge shell for Linux includes powerful features such as:

- Native ASCII clam
- Easy navigation, creation, and deletion of files and directories
- **Hacker mode**
- **Evil mode**
- And so much more…

**cShell** is actively being developed at a **very slow** pace. College and work take up a lot of time, and this project is just my way of dipping my toes into **C** and learning about shells and **syscalls**.

While **cShell** is clearly **better** than other shells like **Bash** or **ZShell**, it's not quite as feature-rich. I wouldn’t recommend replacing your current shell program with it—unless, of course, you *really* hate yourself. In that case, I am not liable for any damage to your psyche incurred during the use of this program.
